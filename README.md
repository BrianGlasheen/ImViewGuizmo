# ImViewGuizmo

An **immediate-mode 3D view gizmo** for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), inspired by the navigation widgets found in **Blender** and **Godot**.  
It provides an interactive axis widget you can click, drag, and snap to, making it easy to control camera orientation in 3D viewports.
